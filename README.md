## About Rat City

Rats have taken over New York City!

You are currently a student at Flatiron School taking the uptown 4 train to get home from Bowling Green station, but the Rat King has stopped the trains. Once you have gotten past the rats in each station, the subway will take you to your next stop. Collect pizza slices for points, hearts for extra lives, and crumpled beer cans to defeat the rat bosses.

Be careful, the rats get faster at each level and there are surprise obstacles along the way!

Intended for ages 4+

## Gameplay
Use the left, right, and up arrows on your keyboard to move your player. When you get to the boss levels, press the spacebar to shoot crumpled beer cans at the boss. Avoid the rats and other obstacles that come your way, and try to collect as many boosters as possible. When you reach the subway station columns, you have completed the level!
