            Rats have taken over New York City, and it's your job to save your home from being devoured! Your goal is to find the three mafia boss rats that are sending out their army of rats and defeat them in battle. Avoid the rats and pigeons that might come your way and try to collect pizza along the way!
          </p>
          <p>
            There are fourteen levels in total and three boss levels. Remember to collect as much crumpled up beer cans as possible -- you'll need those to fight the boss rats! Use the left and right arrow keys to move left and right, and the up arrow key to jump. There will be clues and tips written at the top of each level.
